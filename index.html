                            Create a simple webpage named Zhaopeng’s Resume by using HTML5 and CSS3. In the webpage development, lots of HTML elements such as ‘nav’, ‘li’, ‘span’, ‘div’, ‘time’ and ‘a’ were utilized. Images were inserted at proper position to beautify the webpage. Animations and pseudo-elements help the page easier to read and to operate. Compatibility CSS codes were added to optimize the reliability of the webpage. Testing was done under Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera and IE11.
